### 3AM Game - Fall 2021 PROG 101 Midterm Assignment
```markdown 
Game Objective: You need to buy something from the gas station at 3 o’clock in the morning. 
                However, your late night gas station run gets turned on its head 
                when the gas station won’t let you leave.
                          
This is a choice-based adventure game where the player can interact with 
and play mini games with the non-player characters.
